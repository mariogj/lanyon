### Features

MSS includes a multi-camera system able to simulate the management of several distributed virtual cameras in real time and allows to design and to load realistic 3D environments. Main features of MSS are:

* Multiple cameras freely located in the scenario.
* 
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)
* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404](/404), [RSS feed](/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
