## What is Multi Camera Simulator?

Multi Camera Simulator (MSS) is simulation software  tool helping Computer Vision researchers to test and to design proof-of-concepts Vision algorithms. It can be an alternative to traditional datasets (video, PTZ cameras) specially in scenarios where we can't easily replicate in the real world. 

Let's see an example.
