## What is Multi Camera Simulator?

Multi Camera Simulator (MSS) is simulation software  tool helping Computer Vision researchers to test and to design proof-of-concepts Vision algorithms. It can be an alternative to traditional datasets (video, PTZ cameras) specially in scenarios where we have not information or can not easily replicate in the real word.  

Let's see an example.
