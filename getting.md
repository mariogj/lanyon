## What is Multi Camera Simulator?

Multi Camera Simulator (MSS) is a simulation software tool based on Unity helping Computer Vision researchers to test and to design proof-of-concepts Vision algorithms. It can be an alternative to traditional datasets (video, PTZ cameras) specially in scenarios where we have not information or can not easily replicate in the real word.  

What can you do with MSS?

* Simulate or load any 3D scenario including animated models (pedestrians, cars...)
* Multiple cameras syncronizhed with independient streams
* Customizable cameras in real-time (fps, location, resolution, FOV...)
* 3D models with Artificial Intelligence or custom events


## How it works

Do you have experience with OpenCV? Then, you will understand our application quickly. LetÂ´s see an example.
