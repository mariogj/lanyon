## What is Multi Camera Simulator?

Multi Camera Simulator (MSS) is a simulation software tool based on Unity helping Computer Vision researchers to test and to design proof-of-concepts Vision algorithms. It can be an alternative to traditional datasets (video, PTZ cameras) specially in scenarios where we have not information or can not easily replicate in the real word.  

What can you do with MSS?

* Simulate or load any 3D scenario including animated models (pedestrians, cars...)
* Generate independient streams from multiple cameras syncronizhed
* Customize cameras in real-time (fps, location, resolution, FOV...)
* Add Artificial Intelligence to 3D models or create custom events
* Repeat an interest situation as many times as you need


## How it works

Do you have experience with OpenCV? Then, you will understand our application quickly. LetÂ´s see an example. We are working on a people detection algorithm.
