## What is Multi Camera Simulator?

Multi Camera Simulator (MSS) is simulation software  tool helping Computer Vision researchers to test and to design proof-of-concepts Vision algorithms. This tool can be an alternative to traditional datasets (video, PTZ cameras) specially in scenarios where we can't easily replicate in the real world. 

Let's see an example.
